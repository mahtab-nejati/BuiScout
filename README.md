# BuiScout

***BuiScout*** is an implementation of ***BCIA***, presented in our paper, ***Understanding the Implications of Changes to Build Systems*** *(ASE'24)*.
*BCIA* is an approach to detect the locations across a `CMake` build system that are affected by a change in the build specifications.

## Setup

*BuiScout* relies on 4 major components that need to be setup and configured with each other.
A docker image of the working environment is available here [TODO] with both the latest versions and the version used for our *ASE'24*.
If you need to clone this repository and epending on your usage, you may choose to adhere to either of the following instructions.
